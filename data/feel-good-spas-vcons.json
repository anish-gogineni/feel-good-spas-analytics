I screenshotted it, it said something about 'Feel Good Spas Anniversary Special'.\nFeel Good Spas: Alright Alice, I'm looking at our active and recently expired promotions, and I don't see anything that matches that description. Our Anniversary Special ended last month, and it was a percentage discount, not a 2-for-1.\nAlice Johnson: Oh, darn. So, there's no way I could still get that, even though I just saw the ad yesterday? I was really looking forward to booking something.\nFeel Good Spas: Unfortunately, Alice, if it’s no longer active, we can't honor it. Sometimes outdated ads remain online longer than they should. I do apologize for the confusion. However, we *do* have a weekday special offering 15% off any facial. Would you be interested in hearing more about that?\nAlice Johnson: Hmm, okay. No, I think I'll pass for now. Thank you for your time anyway. Goodbye."},"type":"transcript"},{"body":{"text":"Customer Alice Johnson inquired about a 2-for-1 massage promotion she saw on Facebook.

I need to reschedule, but the online system says there are no available slots for the next two months.\nEthan Miller: Okay, Ms. Rodriguez. Let me check our system... I see the appointment. Unfortunately, due to high demand and limited staffing, the next available slot for that specific package at your preferred location is indeed in approximately two months. We are unable to make any exceptions at this time.\nAva Rodriguez: That's unacceptable! I booked this weeks ago. I’m flying out of state in a week, so that doesn't work for me at all! Is there ANYTHING you can do? Perhaps offer a similar service at a sister location or provide a refund for the full amount?\nEthan Miller: I understand your frustration, Ms. Rodriguez, but I'm afraid I can't offer a similar service at another location or process a refund at this point since cancellations within 24 hours are not eligible for refunds, as stated in our policy. The best I can suggest is keeping your current appointment or rescheduling for a later date."},"type":"transcript","dialog":0,"vendor":"hugging_face_whisper","encoding":"none","vendor_schema":{"opts":{"API_URL":"https://aj5q4xncu7f0a7yk.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud","Content-Type":"audio/flac","minimum_duration":30}}},{"body":{"text":"The customer, Ava Rodriguez, wanted to reschedule her spa appointment but was unable to find a suitable alternative and was denied a refund, resulting in an unresolved and unsatisfactory outcome."},"type":"summary","dialog":0,"vendor":"gemini","encoding":"none","vendor_schema":{"model":"gemini-2.0-flash","prompt":"Summarize this vCon transcript call in 1–2 concise sentences, capturing the main topic discussed and any key decision or next step."}}],"created_at":"2025-06-02T03:09:51.412156Z","updated_at":"2025-06-02T03:09:51.412164Z","attachments":[{"body":["duration:413","location:feelgoodspasdetroit","organization:feelgoodspas","call_type:inbound"],"type":"tags","encoding":"json"}]}},{"id":"d5709574-cc15-4fd3-8f09-ff22d5fd3f63","uuid":"d5709574-cc15-4fd3-8f09-ff22d5fd3f63","vcon_version":"0.0.1","subject":"Customer Service Call - Booking Change","created_at":"2025-06-02T07:12:22.592Z","updated_at":"2025-06-02T07:12:22.592Z","vcon_json":{"uuid":"d5709574-cc15-4fd3-8f09-ff22d5fd3f63","vcon":"0.0.1","dialog":[{"body":"Thank you for calling Feel Good Spas support, this is Liam.
